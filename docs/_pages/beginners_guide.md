Welcome to Blawx!

## What is Blawx?

Blawx is a web-based, user-friendly tool for Rules as Code. It is free, open
source software provided under the MIT license by Jason Morris.

It is alpha software, and not yet appropriate for use in production environments.

## What is Rules As Code?

Rules as Code is the idea that legislation, regulations, contracts, and other forms
of formal written legal rules can and should be written in languages computers can understand and use.

Some adherents want to translate existing laws into code to improve automation of legal services.

Others want to write laws and regulations in natural languages and programming languages at the same time, in an interdisciplinary way, to improve legal drafting, public policy, and automation in public administration.
