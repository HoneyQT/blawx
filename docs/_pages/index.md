This documentation can be reached at any time by choosing "Help" in the menu
of the Blawx interface.

The Blawx documentation is divided into a guide section, and a reference section. The guide section includes the Beginner's Guide to Blawx,
an Advanced Topics section,
and an Examples section.

Details on specific interface elements and how they work are included in the "Specific Blocks" section. The pages in this section are also accessible by
right-clicking on a block in the Blawx interface and choosing "Help."

This is a development version of Blawx. The documentation is a work in progress. Some pages may not include much detail, and some examples may be out of date compared to the interface. If you would like to help keep the Blawx
documentation up-to-date, you can submit pull requests at the [Blawx GitHub repository](https://github.com/Blawx/blawx).
