[Docassemble](https://docassemble.org) is a popular and sophisticated open source tool for generating web-based legal interviews and doing document assembly on the basis of the data collected.

In order to demonstrate the use of the Blawx Reasoner API, we have developed a Python module for use in Docassemble that allows you to easily use Blawx code inside a Docassemble interview.

For details, see the [GitHub package](https://github.com/Blawx/docassemble-blawx).
