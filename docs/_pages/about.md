# About Blawx

Blawx is an open source, web-based, user-friendly interface
to the [Flora-2 programming language](https://flora.sourceforge.net)
built on [Google's Blockly library](https://developers.google.com/blockly),
intended for use in encoding legislation and contracts.

Blocks + Law = Blawx.

It is maintained by [Jason Morris](https://github.com/Gauntlet173).

An article featuring (an earlier version of) Blawx is available at the [MIT Computational Law Report](https://law.mit.edu/pub/blawxrulesascodedemonstration/release/1).
