The Object Selector Block is available in the Known Objects drawer of the Toolbox. It is created automatically when you use a New Object in Category Block.

Note that if you change the name of an object in a New Object in Category Block, the name of the corresponding Object Selector Blocks will not change automatically, and you must delete and replace them.
