# Date Minus Block
![date_minus block]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/date_minus.png "Date Minus Block")

The Date Minus Block is available in the Date and Times section of the "Data Statements" drawer of the Toolbox. It accepts two dates or datetimes, and returns the duration between them. Note that it prefers days to months, so the duration between February 2 and March 2 of a non-leap-year will be returned as "28 days", not "1 month."
