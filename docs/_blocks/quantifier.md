# Quantifier Block
![quantifier block]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/quantifier.png "Quantifier Block")

The Quantifier Block is available in the Logic drawer of the Toolbox. It accepts a quantification type, either "any" or "all", a variable, and a set of statements. If the statements are true for "any" or "all" (as appropriate) of the values which bind to the variable, the statement returns "true."

Existential quantification (using the "any") is usually implicit in Blawx, so this block will be usually be used when you want to check to see if something is always true for any value that binds to a variable.
