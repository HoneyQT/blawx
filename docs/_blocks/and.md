![and block]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/and.png "And Block")

The "And" block is found in the "Logic" drawer of the toolbox. It accepts two sets of statements, and returns a value of "True" if both sets of statements return a value of "True."

Note that in most instances it is not necessary to use the "And" block in order to have this effect. The same effect is available in most instances by stacking statements vertically. This also prevents the need to nest "And" blocks, which can make longer statements difficult to read.
