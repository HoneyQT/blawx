# Attribute Selector Block
![attribute selector block]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/attribute_selector.png "Attribute Selector Block")

An attribute selector block is used to test for the truth of the statement. It accepts a variable or object in the first input connector, and accepts a variable or a value of the attribute's type in the second connector.

The attribute selector block appears in the Known Attributes drawer of the toolbox when you use an attribute declaration block.

See the Begginer's Guide section on [Categories, Objects, and Attributes]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/pages/categories_and_objects/) for examples.
