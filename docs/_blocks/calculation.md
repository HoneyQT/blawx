![calculation block]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/calculation.png "Calculation Block")

The calculation block can be found in the "Number" section of the Data Statements drawer of the toolbox. It accepts a variable in the first input, and a set of inputs that resolve to a number in the second input. It sets the value of that variable to the number received from the right side. Mathematical operators can only be used in the right side of a calculation block.
