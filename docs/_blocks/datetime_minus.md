![datetime_minus block]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/datetime_minus.png "Date and Time Minus Block")

The Date and Time Minus Block is available in the Dates and Times section of the "Data Statements" drawer of the Toolbox. It accepts two dates and times , and returns the duration between them. Note that the duration prefers days to months, so the duraction between February 2 and March 2 of a non-leap-year will be returned as a duration of 28 days.
