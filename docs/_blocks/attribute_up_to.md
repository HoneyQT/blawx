# New Attribute Up To X Block
![attribute_up_to block]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/attribute_up_to.png "New Attribute Up To X Block")

The New Attribute Up to X Block is used to create an attribute inside a [Category Attribute Block]({{ site.basurl}}/docs/blocks/category_attribute/).

It accepts an integer value of 1 or higher. It indicates that the code is expecting a maximum of that number of values for this attribute for each object in the category.

Note that Blawx does not currently use the cardinality values expressed in New Attribute blocks. In future versions, compliance with cardinality requirements will be possible at run-time, and the cardinalities will be used to simplify the creation of expert system user interfaces.
