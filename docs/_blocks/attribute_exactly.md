# New Attribute Exactly Block
![attribute_exactly block]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/attribute_exactly.png "New Attribute Exactly Block")

The New Attribute Exactly Block is used to create an attribute inside a [Category Attribute Block]({{ site.basurl}}/docs/blocks/category_attribute/).

It accepts an integer of 1 or higher.

Note that Blawx does not currently use the cardinality values expressed in New Attribute blocks. In future versions, compliance with cardinality requirements will be possible at run-time, and the cardinalities will be used to simplify the creation of expert system user interfaces.
