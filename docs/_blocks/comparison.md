# Comparison Block
![comparison block]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/comparitor.png "Comparison Block")

The comparison block is found in the "Logic" drawer of the toolbox. It returns a "True" or "False" value depending on whether the stated comparison is correct. The first and second inputs receive values or variables. The types of comparisons available are:

* ">" - Greater Than
* ">=" - Greater Than, or Equal To
* "<" - Less Than
* "<=" - Less Than, or Equal To
* "==" - Equal To
* "!=" - Not Equal To
* "!==" - Not Identical

Note that the comparison block will work with values other than numbers. Dates and Times are considered "less" if they are earlier, and text is considered less if it comes earlier in alphabetical order.

Identity can be checked using the Object Equivalence Block.
