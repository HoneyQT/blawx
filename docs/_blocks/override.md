The Override Block is available in the Facts, Rules, and Queries drawer of the Toolbox. It accepts two text fields, which refer to the Rule Names provided in Rule Blocks. Using an override block specifies that when the two rules named come to contradictory conclusions, the the conclusion of the first rule named stands, and the conclusion of the second rule named is defeated.
