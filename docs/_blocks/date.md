![date block]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/date.png "Date Block")

The Date Block is used to refer to the Date data type. It is available in the "Data Types" drawer of the Toolbox, and is used in New Attribute blocks. A date is used when you want to record a calendar date, not a specific time during that calendar date.
