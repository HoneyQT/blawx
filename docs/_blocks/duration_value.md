![duration_value block]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/duration_value.png "Duration Value Block")

The Duration Value Block is available in the Dates and Times section of the Data Values Drawer in the Toolbox. It is used to create a duration value. It accepts a sign (either positive or negative), and six numbers for years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. The seconds value can include decimal points, all other values must be integers.

Note that there are multiple ways to express the same duration. A week could be specified as 7 days, or as 168 hours. The resutling duration values are equal to one another.
