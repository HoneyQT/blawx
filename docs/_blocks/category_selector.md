# Category Selector Block
![category selector block]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/category_selector.png "Category Selector Block")

A category selector block is used to refer to a Category, and is created and placed in the "Known Categories" drawer of the toolbox when you use a New Category block.

See the Begginer's Guide section on [Categories, Objects, and Attributes]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/pages/categories_and_objects/) for examples.
