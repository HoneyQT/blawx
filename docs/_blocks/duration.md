![duration datatype selector]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/duration.png "Duration Datatype Selector")

The Duration Datatype Selector is used to refer to the Duration data type. It is available in the "Data Types" drawer of the Toolbox, and is used in New Attribute blocks. A Duration is used when you want to record an amount of time, without being specific about the start and the end.  For example, the running time of a movie is a duration. Durations are also used to specify deadlines, such as "within 3 days". In that statement, "3 days" is a duration.
