The include block is available in the "Facts, Rules, and Queries" drawer of the Toolbox, and is used to include the contents of a .blawx file available on the internet in the current workspace.

When the block is created, your browser will ask you to specify the URL of the .blawx file available online. That file will immediately be downloaded and the categories, attributes, and objects in that file will become available in your workspace.

Note that for the time being Include blocks cannot be edited, and must be deleted and recreated if there is an error.
