![date_plus block]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/date_plus.png "Date Plus Block")

The Date Plus Block is available in the Date and Times section of the "Data Statements" drawer of the Toolbox. It accepts a date or date and time, and a duration, and returns a new date that duration away from the date provided. By using the Date Plus Block with a negative duration, you can subtract a period of time from a date.
