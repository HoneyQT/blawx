# Category Weight Block
![category weight block]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/category_weight.png "Category Weight Block")

The category weight block allows you to assign a "weight" value (an integer 0 or higher) to
a category declared in a new category block directly above it.

## Future Use

Currently, the "weight" is not used for anything, and the block will not affect your code. It is intended to be used in future version of Blawx to simplify the process of generating expert system interfaces for testing.
