![unnamed_variable block]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/unnamed_variable.png "Unnamed Variable Selector Block")

The Unnamed Variable Selector Block is available in the Variables drawer of the Toolbox, and is used to create a variable that will only be used once in the associated statements. Unnamed variables are also silent, and will not be included in results if used in a query.
