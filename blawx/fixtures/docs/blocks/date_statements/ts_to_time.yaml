      ## Where Is It?

      The Timestamp to Time Block is found in the Dates drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The timestamp to time block accepts a number which represents a time represented as seconds
      from midnight, and returns a time value.

      ## Technical Details

      The Timestamp to date block is a value block that accepts a number or a variable and outputs a Time.

      ## Tips

      The timestamp to date block does not validate the number provided. For consistent results, the
      number should be less than 86400. To specify times longer than one day, use the timestamp to duration block.
