      ## Where Is It?

      The Time Constructor block is located in the data statements drawer of the Blawx toolbox,
      in the date sub-drawer.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The Time Constructor block is used to generate a time value dynamically.

      ## Technical Details

      The time constructor block is a value block that returns a value of type time.  It can be
      used anywhere that a time value block can be used.

      It accepts three inputs, representing the hours, minutes, and seconds. The inputs can be
      provided with numbers, or variables. For a time to be valid, hours must be an
      integer between 0 and 23, minutes must be an integer between 0 and 59, and seconds
      must be a non-negative number less than 60.
