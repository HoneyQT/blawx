      ![Timestamp to Date Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/ts_to_date.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The Timestamp to Date Block is found in the Dates drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The timestamp to date block accepts a number which represents a POSIX date, and returns
      a date value for use in other date blocks.

      ## Technical Details

      The Timestamp to date block accepts a number or a variable and outputs a Date.

      ## Tips

      The timestamp to date block does not validate the number provided. For consistent results,
      it should be a posix timestamp as of midnight at the start of a calendar day, or a multiple of 86400.
