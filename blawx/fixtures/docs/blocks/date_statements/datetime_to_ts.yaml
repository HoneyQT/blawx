      ![Datetime to Timestamp Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/datetime_to_ts.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The Datetime to Timestamp Block is found in the Dates drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The Datetime to Timestamp block has two inputs that are expecting a datetime, and a number
      represeting a POSIX timestamp. The first input must be bound to a datetime value for
      the block to operate. If the second input is bound to a specific number value, the block
      will evaluate as true if the timestamp and datetime match. If the second input is a variable,
      it will be bound to the POSIX timestamp number value that corresponds to the datetime in the first input.

      ## Technical Details

      The Datetime to Timestamp block is a statement and can be stacked with other statement blocks.

      ## Tips

      The Datetime to Timestamp block cannot be used to generate a datetime from a timestamp. To do
      that, use the Timestamp to Datetime block.
