      ## Where Is It?

      The Date Comparison block is located in the dates drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The Date Comparison block is used to find out if one date or datetime is before, after, the same
      as or different from another date or datetime value.

      ## Technical Details

      The Date Comparison block is a statement block that can be stacked with other statements.

      It accepts two inputs, both of which are expected to be dates, datetimes, or variables, and has a dropdown
      field that indicates the type of comparison you want to do.


      ## Tips

      If you compare a date, it will be treated as though you were comparing 12:00am on that date.
