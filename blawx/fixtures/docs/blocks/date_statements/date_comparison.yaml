      ![Date Comparison Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/date_comparison.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The Date Comparison block is located in the data statements drawer of the Blawx toolbox,
      in the date sub-drawer.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The Date Comparison block is used to find out if one date or datetime is before, after, or the same
      as another date or datetime value.

      ## Technical Details

      The Date Comparison block is a statement block that can be stacked with other statements.

      It accepts two inputs, both of which are expected to be dates, datetimes, or variables, and has a dropdown
      field that indicates the type of comparison you want to do.

      If you compare a date, it will be treated as though you were comparing 12:00am on that date.
