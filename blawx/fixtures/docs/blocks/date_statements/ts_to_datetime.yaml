      # Timestamp to Datetime Block

      ![Timestamp to Datetime Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/ts_to_datetime.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The Timestamp to Datetime Block is found in the Dates drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The Timestamp to Datetime block has two inputs that are expecting a number representing
      a posix timestamp, and a datetime. The first input must be bound to a number value for
      the block to operate. If the second input is bound to a specific datetime value, the block
      will evaluate as true if the timestamp and datetime match. If the second input is a variable,
      it will be bound to the datetime that corresponds to the timestamp in the first input.

      ## Technical Details

      The Timestamp to Datetime block is a statement and can be stacked with other statement blocks.

      ## Tips

      The Timestamp to Datetime block cannot be used to generate a timestamp from a datetime. To do
      that, use the Datetime to Timestamp block.
