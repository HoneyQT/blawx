      # Duration Between Block

      ![Duration Between Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/duration_between.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The Duration Between block is located in the data statements drawer of the Blawx toolbox,
      in the date sub-drawer.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The Duration Between block is used to calculate the duration between two date or datetime values.

      ## Technical Details

      The Duration Between block is a statement block that can be stacked with other statement blocks.

      It accepts three inputs. The first two must be dates, datetimes, or variables. The third must be a duration
      or a variable.  If the first two inputs are bound to date or datetime values, the third will be bound to
      a duration that indicates the time that has passed between the two date or datetimes. Dates will be treated
      as midnight on the given date. 

      ## Tips

      Unlike previous versions of Blawx, the duration between block will return a simplified duration indicating
      the time between two dates. It may return any number of years, or days, but will not return more than 12 months, 
      more than 23 hours, 59 minutes or 60 or more seconds.

      The use of durations including year and month values is not recommended, as they tend to behave
      in unpredictable ways, given that months and years are not of a consistent duration.
