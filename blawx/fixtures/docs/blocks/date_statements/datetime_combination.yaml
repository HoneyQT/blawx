      # Datetime Combination Block

      ![Datetime Combination Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/datetime_constructor.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The Datetime Combination  block is located in the dates drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The Datetime Combination block is used to generate a datetime value dynamically from an existing date and time,
      or to extract date and time values from an existing datetime.

      ## Technical Details

      The datetime constructor block is a statement block that relates a datetime to its constituent date and time. It can
      be stacked with other statement blocks

      It accepts three inputs: a date, a time, and a datetime. If the datetime is bound to a valid datetime, the date and time
      will be bound to its parts. If the date and time are bound to valid values, the datetime will be bound to their combination.
