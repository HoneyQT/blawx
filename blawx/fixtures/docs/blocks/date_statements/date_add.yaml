      # Date Add Block

      ![Date Add Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/date_add.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The Date Add block is located in the data statments drawer of the Blawx toolbox,
      in the Date sub-drawer.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The Date Add block is used to calculate a new date value by adding a duration to
      an existing date value.

      ## Technical Details

      The Date Add block is a statement block that can be stacked with other statements.

      It accepts three inputs: a duration value, and two date or datetime values.

      If the first variable is bound to a duration, and the second value is bound to a
      date or datetime, the third variable will be bound to the datetime obtained by adding the duration
      to the given date or datetime.  If all three are bound, it will check whether the relationship
      holds.

      To subtract a duration from a date or datetime, use a negative sign in the duration.

      If you add a duration to a date, Blawx will add the duration to 12:00am on that date.
