      # Datetime Constructor Block

      ![Datetime Constructor Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/datetime_calculation.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The Datetime Constructor block is located in the data statements drawer of the Blawx toolbox,
      in the date sub-drawer.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The Datetime Constructor block is used to generate a datetime value dynamically.

      ## Technical Details

      The datetime constructor block is a value block that returns a value of type datetime.  It can be
      used anywhere that a datetime value block can be used.

      It accepts six inputs, each of which must be a number or a variable. For the datetime to be valid,
      the year must be an integer, month must be an integer between 1 and 12, day must be a valid integer
      between 1 and 31, hours must be an integer between 0 and 23, minutes must be an integer between 0 and 59,
      and seconds must be a non-negative number less than 60.

      ## Tips

      While the datetime value block will prevent you from entering invalid months (like 13)
      and invalid days (like 40), the datetime constructor block cannot. If you are using
      number value blocks in all six inputs of the date constructor block (you are not using
      any variables), it is a better practice to use the datetime value block instead.
