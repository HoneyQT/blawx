      ![Duration Comparison Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/duration_comparison.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The Duration Comparison block is located in the dates drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The Duration Comparison block is used to find out if one duration is larger, smaller, the
      same size as or different from another duration.

      ## Technical Details

      The Duration Comparison block is a statement block that can be stacked with other statements.

      It accepts two inputs, both of which are expected to be durations, or variables, and has a dropdown
      field that indicates the type of comparison you want to do.


      ## Tips

      Negative durations are "smaller" than positive durations.
