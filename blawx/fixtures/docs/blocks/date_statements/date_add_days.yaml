      ## Where Is It?

      The Date Add Days block is located in the dates drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The Date Add Days block is used to calculate a new datetime value by adding a number of days to
      an existing date or datetime value.

      ## Technical Details

      The Date Add Days block is a statement block that can be stacked with other statements.

      It accepts three inputs: a number of days, and two date or datetime values.

      The number of days can include partial days, using decimals such as `5.4`.

      If the first variable is bound to a number of days, and the second value is bound to a
      date or datetime, the third variable will be bound to the datetime obtained by adding that
      number of days to the datetime provided.  If all three are bound, it will check whether the relationship
      holds.

      To subtract a number of days from a date or datetime, use a negative value in the number of days.
