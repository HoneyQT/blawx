      # Duration Constructor Block

      ![Duration Constructor Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/duration_constructor.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The Duration Constructor block is located in the data statements drawer of the Blawx toolbox,
      in the date sub-drawer.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The Duration Constructor block is used to dynamically generate a duration value.

      ## Technical Details

      The Duration Constructor block is a value block that can be used anywhere a duration value block
      can be used, and returns a duration value.

      The Duration Constructor block has seven inputs, which accept number values or variables.

      While the duration constructor block will accept any numerical values, a duration value
      will only be valid if:

      * the sign value is either `1` (for into the future) or `-1` (for into the past)
      * the years, months, and days, hours and minutes are non-negative integers
      * the seconds value is a non-negative number

      ## Tips

      If you are not using variables in your duration constructor, you are better off using the duration
      value block, which will do more validation of your input to make sure it is a valid duration.

      The use of durations including year and month values is not recommended, as they tend to behave
      in unpredictable ways, given that months and years are not of a consistent duration.
