      # Days Between Block

      ![Days Between Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/days_between.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The Days Between block is located in the data statements drawer of the Blawx toolbox,
      in the date sub-drawer.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The Days Between block is used to generate a number value that represents the number
      of days that passed between two dates.

      ## Technical Details

      The days between block is a statement block, that can be stacked with other statement
      blocks.

      It accepts three inputs, the first two of which must be dates, datetimes, or variables. The third
      input must be a number or a variable.  If the first two inputs are bound, the variable
      in the third input will be bound to a number indicating the number of calendar days
      that pass between the two dates or datetimes.

      ## Tips

      The starting date is not counted, but the ending date is. So the number of days
      between today and tomorrow is always 1.

      If you use datetimes, the times are taken into account. The number of days between 1pm on
      one day and 11am the following day will be less than 1.
