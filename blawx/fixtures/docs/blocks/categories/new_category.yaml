      ![New Category Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/new_category.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The new category block is found in the Categories drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The new category block is used to create a new category of objects.

      ## Technical Details

      The new category block is a statement, and can be stacked with other statements.

      The new category block accepts the name of the category. To be valid, the name of the category must begin with a lower-case letter and not
      include any spaces.

      It also accepts text that should appear before and after the name of the object in explanations.

      ## Tips

      Names of categories should be unique, but can safely
      overlap with the names of non-boolean attributes.
