      # Attribute Selector Block

      ![Attribute Selector Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/attribute_selector.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The attribute selector block is located in the Known Attributes drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The attribute selector block is used to set or test a value for an attribute of a given object.

      ## Technical Details

      The attribute selector block's appearance is determined by the attribute declaration block.

      It always has two internal connectors, one for the object, and one for the value. The object
      connector accepts an object or a variable. The value connector accepts a variable, or a value
      of the correct type if the attribute has a datatype, or an object, if the attribute's datatype is
      a category.

      ## Tips

      Most of the work that you will do setting out rules in Blawx will be done using attribute
      selector blocks and variables.
