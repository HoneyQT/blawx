      ![Relationship Selector Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/relationship_selector.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The relationship selector block is located in the Known Relationships drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The relationship selector block is used to set or test a value for a relationship between 3 or more objects and values.

      ## Technical Details

      The relationship selector block's appearance is determined by the new relationship block that defines it.

      It has between 3 and 10 internal connectors for objects and values. If a connector is for a data type, it will only
      accept values of that type and variables. If a connector is for a category, it will accept objects and variables.
