      # According To Block

      ![According To Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/according_to.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The According To block is located in the exceptions drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The According To block is used to query whether a given conclusion
      was reached by a given section of the rules, regardless of whether that conclusion by that section was also overruled.
      
      ## Technical Details
      According to is a statement block, which can be stacked vertically with other statements.
      Its input connection accepts a section selector or a variable.
      Right now there is no way in blawx to assign a section value to a variable, so the only
      variable block that should be used is the "any" variable block.
      
      It also accepts a statements stack, which should be a single statement block representing the conclusion that may
      or may not have tentatively held.

      ## Tips

      It is often not necessary to use the "according to" block. If you use "attributed rules", "according to" statements
      are created automatically for you. And if you query a conclusion, the explanation will indicate which sections of
      your rules found that conclusion. It is most useful for debugging defaults and exceptions in your code.
