      # According To Block

      ![According To Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/according_to.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The According To block is located in the exceptions drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The According To block is used to query whether a given conclusion
      was reached by a given section of the rules, and was not overruled.
      
      ## Technical Details
      According to is a statement block, which can be stacked vertically with other statements.
      Its input connection accepts only a block that returns one or more sections, or a variable.
      Right now there is no way in blawx to assign a section value to a variable, so the only
      variable block that should be used is the "any" variable block. It also accepts a single statements block, which is the conclusion that the
      statement relates to.


      ## Tips

      Because the according to block tests whether a section reached a conclusion *and that conclusion was not defeated*,
      the according to block should not be used in facts or rule conclusions. You should instead use an attributed rule,
      which will generate conclusions that can be queried using the according to block.
