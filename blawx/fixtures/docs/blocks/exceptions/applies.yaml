      # Applies Block

      ![Applies Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/applies.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The Applies block is located in the exceptions drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The Applies block is used to state or query whether a section of your rules applies to an
      object.

      ## Technical Details

      The Applies block is a statement block which can be stacked with other statements. It accepts a
      section selector for the specific section and
      an object or a variable representing the object to which the section does or does not apply.

      ## Tips

      In the current version of Blawx, the applies statement is presumed to be true about all sections
      and objects until you make a statement to the contrary. Therefore, you will generally only need
      to use this block when it is wrapped with the "it is false that" negation block, to indicate
      which sections do not apply to which objects.

      Rules can use the Applies block to check explicitly whether or not an object applies to a given rule.
      Rules generated using the attributed rule block will automatically check the applicability of any
      objects which are named in a object category block in the conditions of the rule, only if
      "subject to applicability" has been selected on the attributed rule block. If rules are not made
      explicitly subject to applicability, statements made with the applies block will have no effect.
