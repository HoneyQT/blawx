      ## Where Is It?

      The Opposes block is located in the exceptions drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The Opposes block is used to specify that two conclusions oppose one another,
      and if both are found one may overrule the other.

      ## Technical Details

      The opposes block is a statement, which can be stacked with other statements. It
      accepts two internal statement stacks, each of which should be filled with a single statement block,
      where the two internal statements should be treated as contradictory by the reasoner.
      The order of the two internal statements is unimportant.

      ## Tips

      If you have a true/false attribute, it is not necessary to use the opposes block
      for Blawx to understand that a "true" value and a "false" value for that attribute for
      the same object are opposing statements.
