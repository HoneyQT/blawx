      # Object Category Block

      ![Object Category Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/object_category.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The object category block is found in the Objects drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The object category block is used to assert (or check) that an object is a member of
      a category.

      ## Technical Details

      The object category block is a statement block, and can be stacked with other statements.

      The first internal connector expects an object or a variable. The second dropdown field
      allows you to select a category.

      In a question or in the conditions of a rule or constraint, the block checks to see whether the object is
      a member of the category. In a conclusion or in a fact, it asserts that the membership is true.

      ## Tips
      
      Generally, in facts you will want to use the new object block, unless the object has already been
      declared as a member of a different category, and you are adding an additional category for that
      object.
