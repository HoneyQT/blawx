      # Attributed Rule Block

      ![Rule Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/attributed_rule.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The attributed rule block is found in the Primary drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The attributed rule block is used to set out rules with which Blawx can infer new
      information from facts, and attribute that conclusion to a section of the legislation.

      The first statement connector, labeled "When we know:", allows you to set
      out the conditions in which the rule is true.

      The second input connector allows you to specify the section of the rule to which the
      conclusion can be attributed.

      The third statement connector allows you to set
      out the new conclusion that can be drawn when the conditions are known to
      be true. This should be a single statement.

      ## Technical Details

      The rule block is an outer block.

      Its top statement connector accepts a stack of one or more condition statements.
      These statements are treated as though they are all connected with an "and"
      operator, and all variable names are shared among them, and with the conclusion.

      Its bottom statement connector accepts exactly one conclusion statement.

      The attributed rule connector actually generates two rules, which can be summarized like this:

      1. If the conditions are true, and the section is not overruled, then according to the section the conclusion is true.
      2. If according to the section the conclusion is true, the conclusion is true.

      See the defaults and exceptions portion of the documentation for more details.

      ## Tips

      Blawx does not currently support an "or" operator. In the meantime, if the same
      conclusion can be reached in multiple ways, that should be represented by
      multiple rules with the same conclusion.

      If multiple rules with the same conclusion, attributed to the same rule exist, all of them will be
      affected by overrules blocks.

      Typically, you will want to avoid having variables in the conclusion that are not
      also present in the conditions.
