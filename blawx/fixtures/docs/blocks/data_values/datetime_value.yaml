      # Datetime Value Block

      ![Datetime Value Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/datetime_value.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The Datetime Value block is located in the data values drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The Datetime Value block is used to provide a specific datetime value.

      ## Technical Details

      The datetime value block is a value block, and can be used anywhere that is expecting
      a value of type "datetime". This is typically in date statement blocks.

      It has six numerical fields, representing the year, month, day, hour, minute, and seconds. Years can be
      negative integers, or zero. Valid months are integers between 1 and 12, and valid days are integers between 1 and 31.
      Valid hours are integers from 0 to 23. Valid minutes are integers from 0 to 59. Any non-negative number less than 60 is
      a valid seconds value.

      ## Tips

      The datetime value block will allow you
      to specify invalid dates, such as `2000 2 30`. This will not cause a problem in the
      Blawx Code Editor, but may result in errors when you run your tests.
