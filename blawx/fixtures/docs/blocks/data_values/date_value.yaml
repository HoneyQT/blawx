      # Date Value Block

      ![Date Value Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/date_value.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The Date Value block is located in the dates drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The Date Value block is used to provide a specific date value.

      ## Technical Details

      The date value block is a value block, and can be used anywhere that is expecting
      a value of type "date". This is typically in date statement blocks.

      It has three numerical fields, representing the year, month, and day. Years can be
      negative integers, or zero. Valid months are integers between 1 and 12, and valid days are integers between 1 and 31.

      ## Tips

      The date value block will allow you
      to specify invalid dates, such as `2000 2 30`. This will not cause a problem in the
      Blawx Code Editor, but may result in errors when you run your tests.
