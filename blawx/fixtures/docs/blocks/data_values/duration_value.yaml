      # Duration Value Block

      ![Duration Value Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/duration_value.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The Duration Value block is located in the data value drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The Duration Value block is used to provide a specific duration value.

      ## Technical Details

      The duration value block is a value block, and can be placed anywhere that is expecting
      a value of the duration type. This is typically in date statement blocks.

      A duration is a combination of a sign, and six numbers representing the years, months,
      days, hours, minutes, and seconds of the duration.
      If the sign is positive ("+"), the duration is "into the future." If the sign
      is negative ("-"), the duration is "into the past." The idea "two months hence"
      could be expressed using the values `+ 0 2 0 0 0 0`. The idea "one year ago" could be expressed
      using the values `- 1 0 0 0 0 0`.

      Seconds can be specified with decimal places, all other values need to be non-negative integers.

      ## Tips

      The use of durations including year and month values is not recommended, as they tend to behave
      in unpredictable ways, given that months and years are not of a consistent length in days.
