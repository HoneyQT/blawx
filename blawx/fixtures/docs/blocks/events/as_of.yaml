      ![As Of Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/as_of.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The As Of block is found in the Events drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The As Of block is used for stating and querying whether a statement holds as of a particular time.
      It accepts a datetime input, and a statement.

      ## Technical Details

      The As Of block is a statement block and can be stacked with other statement blocks.

      ## Tips

      It is generally more effective to use the "From" block for setting out events - the points in time at which
      the truth of certain statements changes. The As Of block is best used to check whether one of those statements
      is true at a given time.
