      ## Where Is It?

      The Initially block is found in the Events drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The initially block is used to indicate that a statement held as of the start of time.
      This can be useful for queries using the during block, so that a period can be specified
      from the beginning of time until the statement changed.

      ## Technical Details

      The initially block accepts a single statement block. It is a statement block and can be
      stacked with other statements.
