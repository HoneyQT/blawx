      ## Where Is It?

      The Ultimately block is found in the Events drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The ultimately block is used to indicate that a statement holds as of the end of time.
      This can be useful for queries using the during block, so that a period can be specified
      from the time a statement became true, until the end of time.

      ## Technical Details

      The ultimately block accepts a single statement block. It is a statement block and can be
      stacked with other statements.
