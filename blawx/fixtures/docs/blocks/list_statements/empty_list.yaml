      # Empty List Block

      ![Empty List Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/empty_list.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The Empty List block is located in the data statements drawer of the Blawx toolbox, in the List subdrawer.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The Empty List block is used to provide a value representing empty list. This can be used on its own to indicate that a list is completely empty,
      or it can be used in the "rest" portion of a First Rest Block to indicate that the list has no further elements.

      ## Technical Details

      The Empty List Block is a value block of the list type. It can be used anywhere a list is expected, including in attributes that
      have the list type, and list statement inputs expecting a list.
