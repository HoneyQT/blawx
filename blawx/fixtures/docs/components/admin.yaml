      # Blawx Administration Interface

      The Blawx Administration Interface is available by navigating to `/admin` on your
      Blawx Server.

      The admin interface can be used to view and make changes to the projects owned by anyone on the server,
      and to add, change, and delete user accounts, and change what permissions are granted to what
      user accounts.

      By default, on a new installation of Blawx, there is an admin account created with the user
      name `admin` and the password `blawx2022`. When installing a server to which you want to
      restrict access, make sure to change the admin password immediately.

      ## Restricting User Registration

      If you want to prevent people from being able to create their own user accounts on your Blawx server,
      access the "Blawx Preferences" section of the admin interface, de-select "Allow Registration", and
      click Save.
