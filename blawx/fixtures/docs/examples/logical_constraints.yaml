      # Logical Constraints Example

      All the example projects are available under the New Project button.

      The Logical Constraints example demonstrates the use of the constraint block in blawx.

      It encodes the following clauses:

      ```
      1. Bob is a person.
      2. Bob is 40 years of age.
      3. A person cannot have more than one age.
      4. Bob is 50 years of age.
      ```

      Section 3 is encoded using the constraint block, which prevents the code from returning
      any models in which the constraint is violated. In this case, the constraint is violated
      because bob has been given two ages. So the query "how old is bob" returns no answers.

      If you disable or delete the code in section 2, the query will answer that bob is 50.
      If you disable or delete the code in section 4, the query will answer that bob is 40.
      If you disable or delete the code in section 3, the query will answer that bob is both 50 and 40.
