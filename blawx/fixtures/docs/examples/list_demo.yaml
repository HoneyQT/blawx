      # List Demonstration

      All the example projects are available under the New Project button.

      The List Demonstration example demonstrates the use of lists, list collection, and list aggregation blocks.
      You provide a person with multiple values for "score". The code adds a "10" to that list of values, and then returns
      the average of that new list.
