      # Facts and Assumptions

      **NB: This page is out of date as of v1.4.0-alpha. It will be updated as soon as possible.**

      ## Facts
      A “Fact” in
      Blawx represents a thing that is known with certainty. If you have a fact, you
      need to put it in a Fact block, which looks like this:

      ![fact](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/fact.png)

      Generally speaking, most of the code that you use to create categories, to create
      attributes, and to create objects, will be included in a fact block.

      Fact blocks are also used in tests to set out the fact scenario for that test, if any.

      Generally speaking, it does not make sense to use variables other than "any" in a fact
      block. This is because facts are interpreted by Blawx as rules with the condition
      "always". Imagine, for example, that you made the statement that the variable X is a dog in a fact block,
      like this:

      ![Bad Fact](/static/blawx/docs/images/bad_fact.png)

      That will get interpreted by Blawx as "everything is a dog". That's probably not what
      you meant.  The only thing that a variable can mean, inside a fact block, is "everything".
      There are a few cases where it might be reasonable to make that kind of statement, but
      for the clarity of your code it makes to include those statements as rules, so that it is
      obvious that it is an inference that applies to anything.
      
      It can be helpful to create separate Fact blocks for pieces of information that
      you will be working with at the same time, so that when you are not using them
      you can Collapse and Disable the fact block and all its contents all at once.
      See the [documentation on the Blawx User Interface](/docs/components/interface) for
      details on collapsing and disabling blocks.

      If you ask Blawx whether or not something is true
      that you have stated as a Fact, the answer is always yes, without further explanation.
