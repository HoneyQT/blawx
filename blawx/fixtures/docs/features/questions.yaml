      # Questions

      Once you have encoded rules and described relevant facts in a test,
      you will want to ask a question. That is what the question block is for.

      A question looks like this:

      ![Question Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/question.png)

      The question block must be provided with one or more statements that are your query.
      Like most places in Blawx, if statements are stacked in a question block, they are
      treated as though the word "and" appears between them. So all statements must be
      true at the same time for the reasoner to find an answer to the question.

      There are two kinds of questions... yes/no questions, and search questions.

      ### Yes/No Questions
      A question that does not include variables is a “yes/no” question. An example
      is “Is Socrates Mortal?”

      ![is socrates mortal](/static/blawx/docs/images/is_socrates_mortal.png)

      This question will be answered by the Blawx reasoner with either an Answer with
      an explanation, and no bindings, or as the answer "no models".

      In the context of a yes/no question, the response "no models" means "no". There can
      be only one answer, and the existence of an answer (with any number of explanations)
      means "yes".

      ### Search Questions
      A question that
      includes named variables is a “search” question. Blawx attempts to find any objects
      or values with which it can replace all the variables used in the question
      so that the statements in the question will be true.
      If it can’t find any, it will respond “no models”. If it can find any
      values that fit, it will provide each combination as an answer, tell you what the bindings
      were in that answer, and provide all the explanations for each answer.

      So the question
      “is Socrates Mortal” above, which is a “yes or no” question, can be changed
      into a search by replacing “Socrates” with a variable.

      ### Multiple Questions in One Test

      If you create a test with more than one question block, only one question will be used,
      and it can be difficult to predict which. It is best practice to have only one
      active question block in your tests.
