      This documentation can be reached
      at any time by choosing "Help" in the menu
      of the Blawx interface.

      ## Quick Start

      If you are looking for a quick way to get started, check out:

      * [The Wills Act Tutorial](/docs/examples/wills_tutorial)

      The
      Blawx documentation is divided into a guide section, and a reference section.
      The guide section includes the Beginner's Guide to Blawx,
      an Features section,
      and an Examples section.

      Details on specific interface elements
      and how they work are included in the "Specific Blocks" section. The pages
      in this section are also accessible by
      right-clicking on a block in the Blawx
      interface and choosing "Help."

      Blawx is under active development. The
      documentation is a work in progress. Some pages may not include much detail,
      and some examples may be out of date compared to the interface. If there is
      something missing that you need, or something incorrect, please file an issue
      at the [Blawx GitHub repository](https://github.com/Blawx/blawx).
